## Description

This is an application that allows users to read reviews for different ski resorts. The reviews for each ski resort are broken into specific categories, such as lodging, beginner friendly, affordability, tree runs, etc. This allows the user to decide which ski resort is best for them based on their priorities. The user is able to take a survey that will match them with ski resorts that may be best suited for them. The survey compares other users' reviews of the resorts with what the user selects as categories most important to them.
